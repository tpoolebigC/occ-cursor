### Minor Changes

- [`589c91a`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/589c91a) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Enable cart restoration on non-persistent cart logouts.

**Migration**

Update the logout mutation to include the `cartEntityId` variable + the `cartUnassignResult` node and make sure the `client.fetch` method contains the new variable.

```diff
-mutation LogoutMutation {
+mutation LogoutMutation($cartEntityId: String) {
-  logout {
+  logout(cartEntityId: $cartEntityId) {
    result
+    cartUnassignResult {
+      cart {
+        entityId
+      }
+    }
  }
}
```

- [`32a28b9`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/32a28b9) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Use isomorphic-dompurify to santize any sort of shopper supplied input.

- [`f039b2c`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/f039b2c) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - Properly handle `BigCommerceGQLError` in actions, by returning the error messages from the request.

- [`dd66f96`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/dd66f96) Thanks [@matthewvolk](https://github.com/matthewvolk)! - In order to maintain parity with Stencil's 404 page, we wanted to allow the user to search from the 404 page. Since the search included with the header component is fully featured, we included a CTA to open the same search that you get when clicking the search icon in the header.

**Migration**

Most changes are additive, so they should hopefully be easy to resolve if flagged for merge conflicts. Change #3 below replaces the Search state with the new search context, be sure to pay attention to the new

1. This change adds a new directory under `core/` called `context/` containing a `search-context.tsx` file. Since this is a new file, there shouldn't be any merge conflicts
2. `SearchProvider` is imported into `core/app/providers` and replaces the React fragment (`<>`) that currently wraps `<Toaster>` and `{children}`
3. In `core/vibes/soul/primitives/navigation`, replace `useState` with `useSearch` imported from the new context file, and update the dependency arrays for the `useEffect`'s in the `Navigation component`
4. Add search `Button` that calls `setIsSearchOpen(true)` to the `NotFound` component in `core/vibes/sections/not-found/index.tsx`

- [`62b891c`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/62b891c) Thanks [@jordanarldt](https://github.com/jordanarldt)! - Adds support for nested web page children / trees. Restructure web page routing to support a layout file.

- [`44342ee`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/44342ee) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Sets a default session when any user first visits the page.

- [`ff57b8a`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/ff57b8a) Thanks [@eugene(yevhenii)kuzmenko](<https://github.com/eugene(yevhenii)kuzmenko>)! - Pass analytics cookies to checkout mutation to preserve the analytics session whenever shopper redirects to the external checkout

- [`067d5a4`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/067d5a4) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Move the anonymous session into it's own cookie, separate from Auth.js in order to have better non-persistent cart support.

**Migration**

If you were using `await signIn('anonymous', { redirect: false });`, you'll need to migrate over to using the `await anonymousSignIn()` function. Otherwise, we am only changing the underlying logic in existing API's so pulling in the changes should immediately pick this up.

- [`9b3541d`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/9b3541d) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Adds a new analytics provider meant to replace the other provider. This provider is built being framework agnostic but exposes a react provider to use within context. The initial implementation comes with a Google Analytics provider with some basic events to get started. We need to add some other events around starting checkout, banners, consent loading, and search. This change is additive only so no migration is needed until consumption.

- [`bd3bc8b`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/bd3bc8b) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Implement the new analytics provider, utilizing the GoogleAnalytics provider as the first analytics solution.

Most changes are additive so merge conflicts should be easy to resolve. In order to use the new provider from the previous provider, if it's already not setup in the BigCommerce control panel for checkout analytics, you'll need to add the GA4 property ID. This will automatically be used by the new GoogleAnalytics provider.

- [`70afa5a`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/70afa5a) Thanks [@eugene(yevhenii)kuzmenko](<https://github.com/eugene(yevhenii)kuzmenko>)! - Dispatch Visit started and Product Viewed analytics events

- [`da2a462`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/da2a462) Thanks [@bookernath](https://github.com/bookernath)! - Add currency selector to header

- [`f3b4d90`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/f3b4d90) Thanks [@jordanarldt](https://github.com/jordanarldt)! - Add Wishlist account pages and public wishlist page

- [`59ff1ce`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/59ff1ce) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Fetches the stores URLs on build which can remove the need of setting NEXT_PUBLIC_BIGCOMMERCE_CDN_HOSTNAME. The environment variable is still provided in case customization is needed.

- [`a0e6425`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/a0e6425) Thanks [@eugene(yevhenii)kuzmenko](<https://github.com/eugene(yevhenii)kuzmenko>)! - Adds analytics cookies needed for native analytics.

This is a add-only change, so migration should be as simple as pulling in the new code.

- [`a601f7e`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/a601f7e) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - This refactor optimizes compare for caching and the eventual use of dynamicIO.

**Key modifications include:**

- Our query functions now take in all params required for fetching, instead of accessing dynamic variables internally. This is important to serialize arguments if we want to eventually `use cache`.
- Use `Streamable.from` to generate our streaming props that are passed to our UI components.

**Migration instructions:**

- Updated `/app/[locale]/(default)/compare/page.tsx` to use `Streamable.from` pattern.
- Renamed `getCompareData` query to `getComparedProducts`.
  - Updated query
  - Returns empty `[]` if no product ids are passed

- [`c6e38a6`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/c6e38a6) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Reorganize and cleanup files:
- Moved `core/context/search-context` to `core/lib/search`.
- Moved `core/client/mutations/add-cart-line-item.ts` and `core/client/mutations/create-cart.ts` into `core/lib/cart/*`.
- Removed `core/client/queries/get-cart.ts` in favor of a smaller, more focused query within `core/lib/cart/validate-cart.ts`.

**Migration**

- Replace imports from `~/context/search-context` to `~/lib/search`.
- Replace imports from `~/client/mutations/` to `~/lib/cart/`.
- Remove any direct imports from `~/client/queries/get-cart.ts` and use the new `validate-cart.ts` query instead. If you need the previous `getCart` function, you can copy it from the old file and adapt it to your needs.

- [`7b3b81c`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/7b3b81c) Thanks [@matthewvolk](https://github.com/matthewvolk)! - Replaces the REST-powered `client.fetchShippingZones` method with a GraphQL-powered query containing the `site.settings.shipping.supportedShippingDestinations` field.

**Migration:**

1. The return type of `getShippingCountries` has the same shape as the `Country` BigCommerce GraphQL type, so you should be able to copy the graphql query from `core/app/[locale]/(default)/cart/page-data.ts` into your project and replace the existing `getShippingCountries` method in there.
2. Remove the argument `data.geography` from the `getShippingCountries` invocation in `core/app/[locale]/(default)/cart/page.tsx`
3. Finally, you should be able to delete the file `core/client/management/get-shipping-zones.ts` assuming it is no longer referenced anywhere in `core/`

- [`53e0b5e`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/53e0b5e) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - This refactor optimizes category PLP for caching and the eventual use of dynamicIO. With these changes we leverage data caching to hit mostly cache data for guest shoppers in different locales and with different currencies.

**Key modifications include:**

- We don't stream in Category page data, instead it's a blocking call that will redirect to `notFound` when category is not found. Same for metadata.
- Our query functions now take in all params required for fetching, instead of accessing dynamic variables internally. This is important to serialize arguments if we want to eventually `use cache`.
- Use `Streamable.from` to generate our streaming props that are passed to our UI components.
- Remove use of nuqs' `createSearchParamsCache` in favor of nuqs' `createLoader`.

**Migration instructions:**

- Update `/(facted)/category/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - For this page we are now doing a blocking request for category page data. Instead of having functions that each would read from props, we share streamable functions that can be passed to our UI components. We still stream in filter and product data.
- Update `/(facted)/category/[slug]/page-data.tsx`
  - Request now accept `customerAccessToken` as a prop instead of calling internally.
- Update`/(facted)/category/[slug]/fetch-compare-products.ts`
  - Request now accept `customerAccessToken` as a prop instead of calling internally.
- Update `/(faceted)/fetch-faceted-search.ts`
  - Request now accept `customerAccessToken` and `currencyCode` as a prop instead of calling internally.

- [`537db2c`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/537db2c) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Add the ability to redirect from the login page. Developers can now append a relative path to the `?redirectTo=` query param on the `/login` page. When a shopper successfully logs in, it'll redirect them to the given relative path. Defaults to `/account/orders` to prevent a breaking change.

- [`b20dfb0`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/b20dfb0) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Adds an eslint rule to import expect and test from ~/tests/fixtures instead of the @playwright/test module. This is to create a more consistent testing experience across the codebase.

**Migration**

Any import statements that import `expect` and `test` from `@playwright/test` should be updated to import from `~/tests/fixtures` instead. All other imports from `@playwright/test` should remain unchanged.

```diff
-import { expect, type Page, test } from '@playwright/test';
+import { type Page } from '@playwright/test';
+
+import { expect, test } from '~/tests/fixtures';
```

- [`f0464a8`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/f0464a8) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Drops CSS support for Safari < 15 due to those versions only having 0.09% global usage.

- [`1d6cf64`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/1d6cf64) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Render address fields for customer registration form.

- [`42ded4a`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/42ded4a) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - This refactor optimizes home page, header, and footer for caching and the eventual use of dynamicIO. With these changes we leverage data caching to hit mostly cache data for guest shoppers in different locales and with different currencies.

**Key modifications include:**

- Header and Footer now have a blocking request for the shared data that is the same for all users.
- Data that can change for logged in users is now a separate request.
- Our query functions now take in all params required for fetching, instead of accessing dynamic variables internally. This is important to serialize arguments if we want to eventually `use cache`.
- Dynamic fetches (using customerAccessToken or preferred currency) are now all streaming queries.
- Use `Streamable.from` to generate our streaming props that are passed to our UI components.
- Update Header UI component to allow streaming in of currencies data.

**Migration instructions:**

- Renamed `/app/[locale]/(default)/query.ts` to `/app/[locale]/(default)/page-data.ts`, include page query on this page.
- Updated `/app/[locale]/(default)/page.ts` to use `Streamable.from` pattern.
- Split data that can vary by user from `core/components/footer/fragment.ts` and `core/components/header/fragment.ts`
- Updated `core/components/header/index.tsx` and `core/components/footer/index.tsx` to fetch shared data in a blocking request and pass data that varies by customer as streamable data. Updated to use the new `Streamable.from` pattern.
- [`061063f`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/061063f) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - This refactor optimizes search PLP for caching and the eventual use of dynamicIO. With these changes we leverage data caching to hit mostly cache data for guest shoppers in different locales and with different currencies.

**Key modifications include:**

- We don't stream in Search page data, instead it's a blocking call to get page data.
- Our query functions now take in all params required for fetching, instead of accessing dynamic variables internally. This is important to serialize arguments if we want to eventually `use cache`.
- Use `Streamable.from` to generate our streaming props that are passed to our UI components.
- Remove use of nuqs' `createSearchParamsCache` in favor of nuqs' `createLoader`.

**Migration instructions:**

- Update `/(facted)/search/page.tsx`
  - For this page we are now doing a blocking request for brand page data. Instead of having functions that each would read from props, we share streamable functions that can be passed to our UI components. We still stream in filter and product data.

- [`da2a462`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/da2a462) Thanks [@bookernath](https://github.com/bookernath)! - Adds the ability to redirect after logout.

- [`863d744`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/863d744) Thanks [@chancellorclark](https://github.com/chancellorclark)! - Removes the old analytics provider in favor of the provider that fetches the configuration from the GraphQL API.

- [`061063f`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/061063f) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - This refactor optimizes brand PLP for caching and the eventual use of dynamicIO. With these changes we leverage data caching to hit mostly cache data for guest shoppers in different locales and with different currencies.

**Key modifications include:**

- We don't stream in Brand page data, instead it's a blocking call that will redirect to `notFound` when brand is not found. Same for metadata.
- Our query functions now take in all params required for fetching, instead of accessing dynamic variables internally. This is important to serialize arguments if we want to eventually `use cache`.
- Use `Streamable.from` to generate our streaming props that are passed to our UI components.
- Remove use of nuqs' `createSearchParamsCache` in favor of nuqs' `createLoader`.

**Migration instructions:**

- Update `/(facted)/brand/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - For this page we are now doing a blocking request for brand page data. Instead of having functions that each would read from props, we share streamable functions that can be passed to our UI components. We still stream in filter and product data.
- Update `/(facted)/brand/[slug]/page-data.tsx`
  - Request now accept `customerAccessToken` as a prop instead of calling internally.

```

- [`0779856`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/0779856) Thanks [@matthewvolk](https://github.com/matthewvolk)! - Adds Tailwind classes used to style the checkbox input and label based on the disabled state of the checkbox.

**Migration:**

Since this is a one-file change, you should be able to simply grab the diff from [this PR](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/pull/2399). The main changes to note are that we are [adding a `peer` class](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-sibling-state) to the CheckboxPrimitive.Root, explicitly styling the `enabled` pseudoclass, and only applying hover styles when the checkbox is enabled.

- [`604450d`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/604450d) Thanks [@bookernath](https://github.com/bookernath)! - Re-apply auth grouping approach with middleware exemption to preserve functionality of /login/token endpoint for Customer Login API

- [`6b0c85a`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/6b0c85a) Thanks [@jordanarldt](https://github.com/jordanarldt)! - Remove unused search props, add missing search translations

**Migration**

`core/components/header/index.tsx`

Ensure the following props are passed to the `HeaderSection` navigation prop:

```tsx
        searchInputPlaceholder: t('Search.inputPlaceholder'),
        searchSubmitLabel: t('Search.submitLabel'),
```

`core/messages/en.json`

Add the following keys to the `Components.Header.Search` translations:

```json
        "somethingWentWrong": "Something went wrong. Please try again.",
        "inputPlaceholder": "Search products, categories, brands...",
        "submitLabel": "Search"
```

`core/vibes/soul/primitives/navigation/index.tsx`

Copy all changes from this file:

1. Create `searchSubmitLabel?: string;` property, ensure it is passed into `SearchForm`
2. On the `SearchForm`, remove the `searchCtaLabel = 'View more',` property, as it is unused, and rename `submitLabel` to `searchSubmitLabel`
3. Ensure that `SearchForm` passes `searchSubmitLabel` to the `SearchButton`: `<SubmitButton loading={isPending} submitLabel={searchSubmitLabel} />`
4. Remove the `searchCtaLabel` property from the `SearchResults` component

This is a workaround for a [Radix Select issue](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/3198) that auto selects the first option in the select when submitting a form (even when no selection has been made).

Additionally, fixes an issue of incorrectly adding an empty query param for product options when an option is empty.

**Migration**

Migration is straighforward and requires adding the hidden input to the component and renaming the `name` prop for the `Select` component to something temporary.

- Add translation key for a Publish Wishlist empty state

**Migration**

1. Add the following imports to `core/app/[locale]/(default)/wishlist/[token]/page.tsx`:

```tsx
import { removeEdgesAndNodes } from '@bigcommerce/catalyst-client';
import { WishlistAnalyticsProvider } from '~/app/[locale]/(default)/account/wishlists/[id]/_components/wishlist-analytics-provider';
```

2. Add the following function into the file:

```tsx
const getAnalyticsData = async (token: string, searchParamsPromise: Promise<SearchParams>) => {
  const searchParamsParsed = searchParamsCache.parse(await searchParamsPromise);
  const wishlist = await getPublicWishlist(token, searchParamsParsed);

  if (!wishlist) {
    return [];
  }

  return removeEdgesAndNodes(wishlist.items)
    .map(({ product }) => product)
    .filter((product) => product !== null)
    .map((product) => {
      return {
        id: product.entityId,
        name: product.name,
        sku: product.sku,
        brand: product.brand?.name ?? '',
        price: product.prices?.price.value ?? 0,
        currency: product.prices?.price.currencyCode ?? '',
      };
    });
};
```

3. Wrap the component in the `WishlistAnalyticsProvider`:

```tsx
export default async function PublicWishlist({ params, searchParams }: Props) {
  // ...
  return (
    <WishlistAnalyticsProvider data={Streamable.from(() => getAnalyticsData(token, searchParams))}>
      // ...
    </WishlistAnalyticsProvider>
  );
}
```

4. Update `/core/messages/en.json` "PublishWishlist" to have translations:

```json
  "PublicWishlist": {
    "title": "Public Wish List",
    "defaultName": "Public wish list",
    "emptyWishlist": "This wish list doesn't have any products yet."
  },
```

5. Update `WishlistDetails` component to accept the `emptyStateText` and `placeholderCount` props:

```tsx
// ...
export const WishlistDetails = ({
  className = '',
  wishlist: streamableWishlist,
  emptyStateText,
  paginationInfo,
  headerActions,
  prevHref,
  placeholderCount,
  action,
  removeAction,
}: Props) => {
```

6. Update `WishlistDetails` component to pass the `emptyStateText` and `placeholderCount` props to both the `WishlistDetailSkeleton` and `WishlistItems` components:

```tsx
<WishlistDetailSkeleton
  className={className}
  headerActions={typeof headerActions === 'function' ? headerActions() : headerActions}
  placeholderCount={placeholderCount}
  prevHref={prevHref}
/>
```

```tsx
<WishlistItems
  action={action}
  emptyStateText={emptyStateText}
  items={items}
  placeholderCount={placeholderCount}
  removeAction={removeAction}
  wishlistId={wishlist.id}
/>
```

**Migration**

In `core/middlewares/with-auth.ts`, update the `protectedPathPattern` variable to include an optional path segment for the locale:

```tsx
const protectedPathPattern = new URLPattern({ pathname: `{/:locale}?/(account)/*` });
```

- [`67715bf`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/67715bf) Thanks [@jordanarldt](https://github.com/jordanarldt)! - Update GQL client and auth middleware to handle invalid tokens and invalidate session.

**Summary**

This will ensure that if a user is logged out elsewhere, they will be redirected to the /login page when they try to access a protected route.

Previously, the pages would 404 which is misleading.

**Migration**

1. Copy all changes from the `/core/client` directory and the `/packages/client` directory
2. Copy translation values
3. Copy all changes from the `/core/app/[locale]/(default)/account/` directory server actions
4. Copy all changes from the `/core/app/[locale]/(default)/checkout/route.ts` file

- [`11ecddf`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/11ecddf) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - Update translations.

- [`6c77e57`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/6c77e57) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - This refactor optimizes PDP for caching and the eventual use of dynamicIO. With these changes we leverage data caching to hit mostly cache data for guest shoppers in different locales and with different currencies.

**Key modifications include:**

- Split queries into four:
  - Page Metadata (metadata fields that only depend on locale)
  - Product (for fields that only depend on locale)
  - Streamable Product (for fields that depend on locale and variant selection)
  - Product Pricing and Related Products (for fields that require locale, variant selection, and currency -- in this case, pricing and related products)
- We don't stream in Product data, instead it's a blocking call that will redirect to `notFound` when product is not found.
- Our query functions now take in all params required for fetching, instead of accessing dynamic variables internally. This is important to serialize arguments if we want to eventually `use cache`.
- Use `Streamable.from` to generate our streaming props that are passed to our UI components.
- Update UI components to allow streaming product options before streaming in buy button.

**Migration instructions:**

- Update `/product/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - For this page we are now doing a blocking request that is simplified for metadata and as a base product. Instead of having functions that each would read from props, we share streamable functions that can be passed to our UI components.
- Update `/product/[slug]/page-data.tsx`
  - Expect our requests to be simplified/merged, essentially replacing what we had before for new requests and functions.
- Update`/product/[slug]/_components`.
  - Similar to `page.tsx` and `page.data`, expect changes in the fragments defined and how we pass streamable functions to UI components.
- Update `/vibes/soul/product-detail/index.tsx` & `/vibes/soul/product-detail/product-detail-form.tsx`
  - Minor changes to allow streaming in data.

- [`a19b3ba`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/a19b3ba) Thanks [@jordanarldt](https://github.com/jordanarldt)! - Fix persistent cart behavior during login.

**Migration**

In `core/auth/index.ts`, create the `cartIdSchema` variable:

```ts
const cartIdSchema = z
  .string()
  .uuid()
  .or(z.literal('undefined')) // auth.js seems to pass the cart id as a string literal 'undefined' when not set.
  .optional()
  .transform((val) => (val === 'undefined' ? undefined : val));
```

Then, update all `Credentials` schemas to use this new `cartIdSchema`:

```ts
const PasswordCredentials = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(1),
  cartId: cartIdSchema,
});

const AnonymousCredentials = z.object({
  cartId: cartIdSchema,
});

const JwtCredentials = z.object({
  jwt: z.string(),
  cartId: cartIdSchema,
});

const SessionUpdate = z.object({
  user: z.object({
    cartId: cartIdSchema,
  }),
});
```

**Migration**

To migrate, rename the file with git:

- [`5e5314b`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/5e5314b) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - We want state to be persitent on the `ProductDetailForm`, even after submit. This change will allow the API error messages to properly show when the form is submitted. Additionally, other form fields will retain state (like item quantity).

**Migration**

- Update `ProductDetailForm` to prevent reset on submit, by removing `requestFormReset` in the `onSubmit`.
- Remove `router.refresh()` call and instead call new `revalidateCart` action.
  - `revalidateCart` is an action that `revalidateTag(TAGS.cart)`
  - This prevents the form from fully refreshing on success.

2. Copy changes from `/core/app/[locale]/(default)/account/wishlists/[id]/page.tsx` - Redirect to `/account/wishlists/` on 404
3. Ensure that the `removeButtonTitle` prop is passed down all the way to the `RemoveWishlistItemButton` component in the `WishlistItemCard` component

- [`e8c693a`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/e8c693a) Thanks [@jordanarldt](https://github.com/jordanarldt)! - Add toast message when changing password

**Migration**

`core/vibes/soul/sections/account-settings/change-password-form.tsx`

1. Import `toast`:

```ts
import { toast } from '@/vibes/soul/primitives/toaster';
```

2. Update the `ChangePasswordAction` types:

```ts
type Action<S, P> = (state: Awaited<S>, payload: P) => S | Promise<S>;

interface State {
  lastResult: SubmissionResult | null;
  successMessage?: string;
}

export type ChangePasswordAction = Action<State, FormData>;
```

3. Update the `useActionState` hook:

```ts
const [state, formAction] = useActionState(action, { lastResult: null });
```

4. Update the `useEffect` hook to display a toast message on success:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  if (state.lastResult?.status === 'success' && state.successMessage != null) {
    toast.success(state.successMessage);
  }

  if (state.lastResult?.error) {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
    console.log(state.lastResult.error);
  }
}, [state]);
```

`core/app/[locale]/(default)/account/settings/_actions/change-password.ts`

Update all of the `return` values to match the new `ChangePasswordAction` interface, and return the `passwordUpdated` message on success.

```ts
export const changePassword: ChangePasswordAction = async (prevState, formData) => {
  const t = await getTranslations('Account.Settings');
  const customerAccessToken = await getSessionCustomerAccessToken();

  const submission = parseWithZod(formData, { schema: changePasswordSchema });

  if (submission.status !== 'success') {
    return { lastResult: submission.reply() };
  }

  const input = {
    currentPassword: submission.value.currentPassword,
    newPassword: submission.value.password,
  };

  try {
    const response = await client.fetch({
      document: CustomerChangePasswordMutation,
      variables: {
        input,
      },
      customerAccessToken,
    });

    const result = response.data.customer.changePassword;

    if (result.errors.length > 0) {
      return {
        lastResult: submission.reply({ formErrors: result.errors.map((error) => error.message) }),
      };
    }

    return {
      lastResult: submission.reply(),
      successMessage: t('passwordUpdated'),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
    console.error(error);

    if (error instanceof BigCommerceGQLError) {
      return {
        lastResult: submission.reply({
          formErrors: error.errors.map(({ message }) => message),
        }),
      };
    }

    if (error instanceof Error) {
      return {
        lastResult: submission.reply({ formErrors: [error.message] }),
      };
    }

    return { lastResult: submission.reply({ formErrors: [t('somethingWentWrong')] }) };
  }
};
```

BODL and GA4 integration is encapsulated in `bodl` library which hides current complexity and limitations that will be improved in future. It can be extended with more events and integrations with other analytics providers later. Data transformation from Catalyst data models to BODL and firing events is done in client components, as only frontend events are supported by BODL for now.

  List of currently supported events:
  - View product category
  - View product page
  - Add product to cart
  - View cart
  - Remove product from cart

### Minor Changes

- [#1178](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/pull/1178) [`f592d9f`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/f592d9fe0b71ddd7ceb5e1326ea0280f7b90c3c9) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - This refactor changes the structure of our UI components by replacing composability with a prop-based configuration. This change simplifies the use of our components, eliminating the need to build them individually from a composable approach. Additionally, it provides a single location for all class customizations, improving the experience when fully customizing the component. We believe this approach will make it easier to use components correctly and safeguard against incorrect usage. Ultimately, by adopting a prop-based configuration, we aim to achieve full replaceability and simplify theming for our components.

  Before refactor:

  ```
  <Accordions>
      <AccordionsItem>
          <AccordionsTrigger>
              Title 1
          </AccordionsTrigger>
          <AccordionsContent>
              Item Content 1
          </AccordionsContent>
      </AccordionsItem>
      <AccordionsItem>
          <AccordionsTrigger>
              Title 2
          </AccordionsTrigger>
          <AccordionsContent>
              Item Content 2
          </AccordionsContent>
      </AccordionsItem>
  </Accordions>
  ```

  After refactor:

  ```
  <Accordions accordions={[
      {value: 'Title 1', content: 'Item Content 1'},
      {value: 'Title 2', content: 'Item Content 2'}
  ]}>
  ```

  Before refactor:

  ```
  <Select
      onValueChange={onSort}
      value={value}
  >
      <SelectContent>
          <SelectItem value="featured">Featured</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="newest">Newest</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="best_selling">Best selling</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="a_to_z">A to Z</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="z_to_a">Z to A</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="best_reviewed">By reviews</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="lowest_price">Price ascending</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="highest_price">Price descending</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="relevance">Relevance</SelectItem>
      </SelectContent>
  </Select>
  ```

  After refactor:

  ```
  <Select
      onValueChange={onSort}
      options={[
          { value: 'featured', label: 'Featured' },
          { value: 'newest', label: 'Newest' },
          { value: 'best_selling', label: 'Best selling' },
          { value: 'a_to_z', label: 'A to Z' },
          { value: 'z_to_a', label: 'Z to A' },
          { value: 'best_reviewed', label: 'By reviews'},
          { value: 'lowest_price', label: 'Price ascending' },
          { value: 'highest_price', label: 'Price descending' },
          { value: 'relevance', label: 'Relevance' },
