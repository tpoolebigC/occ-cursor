**Catalyst** is the composable, fully customizable headless commerce framework for
[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/). Catalyst is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), uses
our [React](https://react.dev/) storefront components, and is backed by the
[GraphQL Storefront API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/storefront/graphql).

By choosing Catalyst, you'll have a fully-functional storefront within a few seconds, and spend zero time on wiring
up APIs or building SEO, Accessibility, and Performance-optimized ecommerce components you've probably written many
times before. You can instead go straight to work building your brand and making this your own.

## 🔧 Algolia Setup (The Search Setup)

### Step 1: Create Your Algolia Index
1. Sign up at [algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com) (it's free to start)
2. Create a new index for your products
3. Configure searchable attributes: `name`, `description`, `brand_name`, `categories_without_path`, `sku`

### Step 2: Set Up Your Facets
In your Algolia dashboard, make these attributes into facets:
- `categories_without_path`
- `brand_name` 
- `default_price`
- `in_stock`

### Step 3: Check Your Index
Use the debug script to see what's in your index:
```bash
npm run algolia:debug
```

## 🏢 B2B Setup (The B2B Setup)

### Step 1: Enable B2B Features in BigCommerce
1. In your BigCommerce admin, go to **Settings** → **Store Setup** → **B2B**
2. Enable **B2B Features** (this is the magic switch)
3. Configure customer groups for B2B customers
4. Set up pricing rules and discounts

### Step 2: Get Your B2B API Credentials
1. Go to **Settings** → **API** → **B2B API**
2. Copy your **B2B API Token** (keep this safe!)
3. The B2B API host is usually: `https://api-b2b.bigcommerce.com/`

### Step 3: Test Your B2B Integration
Use these debug pages to make sure everything's working:
```bash
# Check the B2B debug page
http://localhost:3000/b2b-debug

# Check customer debug info
http://localhost:3000/business-test
```
