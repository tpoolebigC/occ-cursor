# üîç Algolia Search Integration: The Complete Guide

Hey there! üëã Ready to make your BigCommerce Catalyst storefront search lightning-fast? You're in the right place! This guide will walk you through setting up Algolia search integration that actually works.

## üéØ What You're Building

You're about to replace BigCommerce's default search with **Algolia's lightning-fast search engine**. This gives your customers:

- **Instant search results** - No more waiting around
- **Faceted search** - Filter by category, brand, price, availability
- **Smart navigation** - "Shop All" and category navigation that works
- **Mobile-optimized** - Great search experience on any device
- **B2B-aware search** - Search results show B2B pricing and features

## üö® Why Algolia Search?

### ‚ùå What's Wrong with Default Search
- **Slow response times** - Users get frustrated waiting
- **Limited filtering** - Can't filter by multiple criteria
- **Poor mobile experience** - Not optimized for phones
- **No faceted search** - Can't drill down into categories
- **Limited customization** - Hard to make it look good

### ‚úÖ What Algolia Gives You
- **Lightning-fast search** - Results in milliseconds
- **Advanced faceting** - Filter by anything you want
- **Mobile-first design** - Works great on all devices
- **Customizable UI** - Make it look exactly how you want
- **Analytics and insights** - See what people are searching for

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites (What You Need Before Starting)

### Algolia Account Setup
- **Algolia account** - Sign up at [algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com) (it's free to start!)
- **Search index** - Where your product data will live
- **API credentials** - To connect your app to Algolia

### BigCommerce Store
- **Product catalog** - Products to search through
- **API access** - To sync product data to Algolia
- **Category structure** - For faceted search

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Algolia Account

1. **Go to [algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**
2. **Sign up for a free account** (you get 10,000 searches/month free!)
3. **Create a new application** (this is your search environment)
4. **Note your Application ID** - You'll need this later

**Pro Tip:** Start with the free plan. You can always upgrade later when you need more searches.

### Step 2: Create Your Search Index

1. **In your Algolia dashboard, create a new index**
2. **Name it something like `BCCatalystTest`** (this is where your product data goes)
3. **Configure searchable attributes** - These are the fields users can search:

```
name
description
brand_name
categories_without_path
sku
```

**Important:** These attributes determine what users can search for. Choose wisely!

### Step 3: Set Up Your Facets

Facets are how users filter search results. In your Algolia dashboard, make these attributes into facets:

```
categories_without_path
brand_name
default_price
in_stock
is_visible
```

**Pro Tip:** Facets should be attributes that users commonly want to filter by.

### Step 4: Get Your API Credentials

1. **Go to your Algolia dashboard**
2. **Navigate to API Keys**
3. **Copy these credentials:**
   - **Application ID** (your app identifier)
   - **Search-Only API Key** (for searching - safe to expose)
   - **Admin API Key** (for indexing - keep this secret!)

**Security Note:** Only use the Search-Only API Key in your frontend code. The Admin API Key should only be used on your server.

### Step 5: Configure Your Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# BigCommerce Configuration (The Basics)
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH=your_store_hash
BIGCOMMERCE_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
BIGCOMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token

# Algolia Configuration (The Search Magic) - UPDATED NAMES
ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=your_algolia_app_id
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_algolia_search_api_key
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=your_algolia_index_name

# B2B Configuration (if using B2B)
B2B_API_TOKEN=your_b2b_api_token
B2B_API_HOST=https://api-b2b.bigcommerce.com/
```

**Critical Note:** We've updated to use the standard Algolia environment variable names (`ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID`, `ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME`) instead of the old `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed names.

### Step 6: Index Your Products

You need to get your BigCommerce products into Algolia. Here are a few ways:

#### Option A: Use the Debug Script (Easiest)
```bash
npm run algolia:debug
```

This will show you what's in your index and help you verify the setup.

#### Option B: Manual Indexing
If you need to index products manually, you can use the Algolia dashboard or API.

#### Option C: Automated Sync
For production, you'll want to set up automated syncing from BigCommerce to Algolia.

## üîß How the Algolia Integration Works

### Search Flow

1. **User types in search box** - Triggers type-ahead search via server action
2. **User submits search** - Redirects to `/search` page with query parameters
3. **Algolia processes query** - Searches through indexed products
4. **Results returned instantly** - With highlighting and facets
5. **User can filter results** - Using faceted search
6. **User clicks on product** - Goes to product detail page

### Faceted Search

Faceted search lets users drill down into results:

- **Category filtering** - Browse by product categories (Plants, Accessories, Pots)
- **Brand filtering** - Filter by brand names (Modern Botany, TMP)
- **Price ranges** - Filter by price brackets with min/max inputs
- **Stock status** - Show in-stock/out-of-stock items
- **Smart defaults** - Category filters only apply when searching

### Navigation Integration

The search integrates with your navigation:

- **Shop All** - Redirects to `/search` page showing all products
- **Category navigation** - Direct links to category pages
- **Breadcrumbs** - Clear navigation hierarchy
- **Search suggestions** - Real-time search suggestions in header

## üß™ Testing Your Algolia Setup

### Search Functionality Testing

1. **Quick Search (Type-ahead)**
   - Test the header search bar
   - Should return results instantly with white background
   - Results should be relevant and clickable

2. **Full Search Page**
   - Visit `/search?term=product`
   - Should show search results page with facets
   - Facets should be available and functional

3. **Shop All**
   - Visit `/shop-all`
   - Should redirect to `/search` showing all products
   - No filters applied initially

4. **Category Navigation**
   - Test category links
   - Should filter by category
   - Results should be accurate

### Faceted Search Testing

1. **Category Filters**
   - Apply category filters (Plants, Accessories, Pots)
   - Results should update immediately
   - URL should reflect filters

2. **Brand Filters**
   - Filter by brand (Modern Botany, TMP)
   - Multiple brands should work
   - Clear filters should work

3. **Price Filters**
   - Filter by price range using min/max inputs
   - Results should be within range
   - Price display should be correct

4. **Stock Filters**
   - Filter by in-stock items
   - Out-of-stock items should be hidden
   - Stock status should be accurate

## üö® Common Issues and How to Fix Them
