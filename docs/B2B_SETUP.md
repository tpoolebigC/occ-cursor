# üè¢ B2B Buyer Portal Integration: The Complete Guide

Hey there! üëã So you want to add B2B functionality to your BigCommerce Catalyst storefront? You've come to the right place! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get B2B buyer portal integration working like a charm.

## üéØ What You're Building

You're about to add **BigCommerce's official B2B buyer portal** to your Catalyst storefront. This gives your B2B customers access to:

- **Quote management** - Create, manage, and convert quotes to orders
- **Shopping lists** - Perfect for team collaboration and bulk ordering  
- **Cart synchronization** - Seamless cart sync between buyer portal and your storefront
- **B2B pricing** - Customer-specific pricing and discounts
- **Product actions** - "Add to Quote" and "Add to Shopping List" buttons

## üö® Important: Why This Approach Works

We tried a bunch of different approaches and here's what we learned:

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work
- **Custom B2B implementations** - Too complex, too many edge cases
- **Direct B2B API integration** - Missing critical features, hard to maintain
- **Third-party B2B solutions** - Expensive, not well integrated

### ‚úÖ What Actually Works
- **BigCommerce-hosted buyer portal** - Official, supported, feature-complete
- **Official B2B integration** - All the features you need, properly tested
- **This implementation** - Production-ready, battle-tested, actually works

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites (What You Need Before Starting)

### BigCommerce Store Setup
- **B2B features enabled** in your BigCommerce admin
- **B2B API access** with proper credentials
- **Customer groups configured** for B2B customers
- **Pricing rules set up** for B2B discounts

### Development Environment
- **Node.js 18+** (because we're not living in the past)
- **BigCommerce store** with API access
- **Environment variables** properly configured

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Enable B2B Features in BigCommerce

1. **Go to your BigCommerce admin**
2. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Store Setup ‚Üí B2B**
3. **Enable B2B Features** (this is the magic switch!)
4. **Configure customer groups** for B2B customers
5. **Set up pricing rules** and discounts

**Pro Tip:** Make sure you have at least one customer group set up for B2B customers. This is crucial for the integration to work properly.

### Step 2: Get Your B2B API Credentials

1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí B2B API**
2. **Copy your B2B API Token** (keep this safe - you'll need it!)
3. **Note the B2B API host**: `https://api-b2b.bigcommerce.com/`

**Important:** The B2B API token is different from your regular BigCommerce API token. You need both!

### Step 3: Configure Your Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# BigCommerce Configuration (The Basics)
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH=your_store_hash
BIGCOMMERCE_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
BIGCOMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token

# B2B Configuration (The B2B Magic)
B2B_API_TOKEN=your_b2b_api_token_here
B2B_API_HOST=https://api-b2b.bigcommerce.com/

# Algolia Configuration (For Search Integration)
ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=your_algolia_app_id
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_algolia_search_api_key
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=your_algolia_index_name
```

**Critical Note:** Make sure `B2B_API_TOKEN` is **required**, not optional. We learned this the hard way!

### Step 4: Install the B2B Integration

The B2B integration is already included in this repository. Here's what you get:

```
core/b2b/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loader.tsx                     # B2B loader script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ use-b2b-auth.ts                # B2B authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ use-b2b-cart.ts                # Cart synchronization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ use-product-details.tsx        # Product actions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ use-b2b-quote-enabled.ts       # Quote functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ use-b2b-shopping-list-enabled.ts # Shopping list functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ map-to-b2b-product-options.tsx # Product options mapping
```

### Step 5: Add B2B Loader to Your Layout

The B2B loader needs to be added to your locale layout. It's already configured in:

```tsx
// core/app/[locale]/layout.tsx
import { B2BLoader } from '~/b2b/loader';

export default function LocaleLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <B2BLoader />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Step 6: Test Your B2B Integration

Use these debug pages to make sure everything's working:

```bash
# Check the B2B debug page
http://localhost:3000/b2b-debug

# Check customer debug info
http://localhost:3000/business-test
```

## üîß How the B2B Integration Works

### B2B Authentication Flow

1. **Customer logs in** to your Catalyst storefront
2. **B2B token is generated** automatically during login via JWT callbacks
3. **Session is established** with B2B capabilities
4. **Customer can access** B2B features (quotes, shopping lists, etc.)

### Cart Synchronization

The B2B integration handles cart sync automatically:

1. **Customer adds items** to cart in buyer portal
2. **Cart ID is synchronized** between buyer portal and Catalyst
3. **Real-time updates** ensure consistency across platforms
4. **No manual intervention** required

### Product Actions

B2B customers get special product actions:

- **Add to Quote** - Add products to quotes for approval

## üîç Debugging Your B2B Setup

### Debug Components

Use these debug pages to troubleshoot:

```bash
# B2B Debug Page - Shows all B2B configuration
http://localhost:3000/b2b-debug

# Business Test Page - Shows customer-specific info
http://localhost:3000/business-test
```

### Console Logging

The B2B loader provides detailed logging. Look for:

```javascript
B2BLoader session: {
  hasSession: true,
  hasUser: true,
  hasB2bToken: true,
  b2bTokenLength: 280,
  cartId: 'cart-id-here',
  userEmail: 'user@example.com'
}
```

### Environment Variable Check

Run this to verify your environment variables:

```bash
npm run env:check
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Vercel Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project:

```env
# BigCommerce Configuration
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH=your_store_hash
BIGCOMMERCE_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
BIGCOMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token

# B2B Configuration
B2B_API_TOKEN=your_b2b_api_token
B2B_API_HOST=https://api-b2b.bigcommerce.com/

ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=your_algolia_app_id
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_algolia_search_api_key
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=your_algolia_index_name
```

### SSL and Security

- **Enable HTTPS** - B2B integration requires secure connections
- **Verify API token security** - Keep tokens secure and rotate regularly
- **Monitor API usage** - Watch for unusual activity

### Buyer Portal URL

The buyer portal URL is automatically configured:
- **Development**: `https://buyer-portal.bigcommerce.com/`
- **Production**: `https://buyer-portal.bigcommerce.com/`
